The internal representation of metrics in the 1.5.0 release of Hystrix is completely different from all releases before.  The general premise of these changes is that it's more flexible to expose a stream of metric events, rather than the prior solution of providing data structures where aggregate queries were possible, but nothing else.  Because this change affects both the internals of Hystrix and the metrics consumption side, it warrants some discussion on how it works and how it may be consumed.
